# MyPlot

MyPlot is a simple Qt widget for plotting. It has no further dependencies and can be easily integrate in Qt projects. 

To get MyPlot to work with your Qt application:

- Download the latest version of MyPlot and copy the myplot.cpp and myplot.h file to your application directory
- In Qt Creator right click on the root entry of your project in the left sidebar and choose *Add Existing Files...*
- In the dialog, select the myplot.cpp and myplot.h file, to add them to your project
- Next, place a QWidget on your form, right click on it and press *Promote to...*
- In the dialog, enter "MyPlot" in the *Promoted Class Name* input field. The input next to *Header File* should be filled automatically with the correct myplot.h. Press "Add" to add Mylot to the promoted classes list and finally press *Promote* to turn the QWidget on your form into a MyPlot.
- You won't see any immediate visual changes in Qt Creater, but while running the application, you will see an empty plot with axes.
